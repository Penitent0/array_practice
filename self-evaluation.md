How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

**I spent a lot of time practicing in irb to get comfortable with what to expect when calling each method on each array. I feel like the unintuitive names of the methods will require some memorization work on my part to get totally comfortable each of them. Ruby-Docs has been a great resource.**

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

**I am going to practice using irb to call different methods from Ruby-Docs on arrays that I create to continue growing my confidence.**

What questions do you have about Arrays?

**Can Arrays include other Arrays? Are the methods pre-defined or will we eventually be able to configure our own methods?**
